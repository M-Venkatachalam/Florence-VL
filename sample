# **Florence-VL on MS-COCO: Vision-Language Alignment and Generation**

This project implements and evaluates the **Florence-VL** model on the **MS-COCO dataset**, focusing on tasks such as **image-text retrieval** and **caption generation**. Florence-VL leverages **Depth-Aware Vision Transformer (DaVIT)** and **Depth-Breadth Fusion (DBFusion)** to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multimodal benchmarks.

---

## **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to replicate the results of the Florence-VL paper, fine-tune the model on MS-COCO, and explore potential improvements to its performance. The project also includes detailed evaluations and visualizations of the model’s outputs, with training logs and analysis.
